## Part 1: Introduction

For this lab the Twitter web crawler was applied for two geographic areas, of the greater San Francisco bay area and the Los Angeles metropolitan area around 5 pm, Friday, April 22nd, 2022.  The goal is to display the difference in culture between north and south California, which the two major metro areas have been selected.  

```
Coordinates used to cover the area are as followed: 
San Francisco: -122.525924, 37.169519,  -121.945848, 37.962409
Los Angeles -118.559606, 33.505677,  -116.971055, 34.211397
```

## Part 2: Maps

Projecting geo-tagged tweets onto maps with QGIS we can see the locations of these tweets.  A common theme of both maps is that most if not all tweets fall on more condensed urban areas, as indicated by the density of roads.  The major difference is that the LA region produced significantly more tweets from the crawler, and more condensed on the coast, while the SF region has it spread out more equally around the bay, landing on more populated areas.

## Part 3: Word Clouds

Although both areas are Californian and of major metropolitan areas, the aura produced by the word clouds differ, indicating the cultural difference between the two.  The SF region consists some more tech related keywords such as google, career, and tesla.  The LA region, however, displays terms that are more touristy and laid back, such as friend, happy, and post.  Another factor that can be considered is the Coachella Valley Music Festival is happening this week, relatively close by LA, meaning that these tweets can be skewed by tourists visiting the area.
